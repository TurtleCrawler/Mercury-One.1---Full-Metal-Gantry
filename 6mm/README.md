# 6mm Full Metal Gantry

___

Stepper Flange Stack assembly:
5x1mm shims as shown in the image below.

M3 washers might be needed with the stepper screws to prevent them from bottoming out in the threads.

Metric plates (3mm thick plates) will require M5x1 shims under the M5 bolts to prevent the threads from bottoming out against the extrusion

## 6mm Xjoints

For the flange stack use 2x M5x0.5 shims and 1x M5x1 shim. You can tighten up the fit with M5x0.1mm shims.

For Gates 20T Idlers use M5x0.3mm shims on either side of the idler. You can tighten up the fit with M5x0.1mm shims.

## 6mm Front Towers

For the flange stack use 2x M5x0.5 shims and 1x M5x1 shim. You can tighten up the fit with M5x0.1mm shims.

The M5 bolt needs a M5x3(Imperial) or M5x4(Metric) spacer under the bolt head, shims or washers can also be used in place of a single spacer.

Make sure to press in the 4 M3x10 smooth spacers inside the printed insert. These should be as tall or taller than the print itself. If your print is taller, file or sand the top of it until the inserts are flush or slightly taller thant the print.
