# 9mm Full Metal Gantry

___

Stepper Flange Stack assembly:
5x1mm shims as shown in the image below, using F695 and 695 bearings.

M3 washers might be needed with the stepper screws to prevent them from bottoming out in the threads.

Metric plates (3mm thick plates) will require M5x1 shims under the M5 bolts to prevent the threads from bottoming out against the extrusion

## 9mm Xjoints

**NOTE:** Make Sure you remove the hub on the pulley, it will interfere with the belt. You will also need to grind the set screws down, or source shorter ones. The set screws are M4 thread.

For the flange stack use 2x M5x1 shims and 1x M5x0.5 shim on the side against the plate, and a single M5x1 shim on the side with the printed spacer. You can tighten up the fit with M5x0.1mm shims.

With the live Idler setup if using a gates pulley, a M5x0.3mm shim is needed between the pulley and bearing. You can use smaller shims to tighten up the play between the printed spacer and bearing.

## 9mm Front Towers

For the flange stack use 2x M5x1 shims and 1x M5x0.5 shim on the side against the plate, and a single M5x1 shim on the side with the printed spacer. You can tighten up the fit with M5x0.1mm shims.

The M5 bolt needs a M5x3(Imperial) or M5x4(Metric) spacer under the bolt head, shims or washers can also be used in place of a single spacer.

Make sure to press in the 4 M3x10 smooth spacers inside the printed insert. These should be as tall or taller than the print itself. If your print is taller, file or sand the top of it until the inserts are flush or slightly taller thant the print.
